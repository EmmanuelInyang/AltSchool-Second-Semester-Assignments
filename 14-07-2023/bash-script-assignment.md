**Bash operators** are symbols used in scripting to perform operations on values and variables, often combined with commands for various tasks, comparisons, and conditions.

Some bash operators include: <br>
**1. Arithmetic Operators** <br>
**2. Logical Operators** <br>
**3. Relational Operators** <br>
**4. File Operators**

**Arithmetic Operators:** <br>
   Bash scripts support 11 arithmetic operators, which include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, increment by a constant, decrement by a constant, multiply by a constant, divide by a constant, remainder by dividing with a constant, and exponentiation. <br>
   The 11 arithmetic operators are explained with examples below: <br>
   **Addition:** It adds two operands. <br>
   ```
   Sum=$((10+4))  
   echo "Sum = $Sum"
   ```
   **Output:**
   Sum = 14
<br>
   **Subtraction:** It subtracts the second operand from the first one.
   ```
   Difference=$((10-3))  
   echo "Difference = $Difference"
   ```
   **Output:**
   Difference = 7
